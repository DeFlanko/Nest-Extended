Nest-Extended
=============

Collect, monitor, and act on extended data from Nest Learning Thermostats.

Currently, Nest-Extended relies on the unofficial Nest API (https://github.com/gboudreau/nest-api/) to gather data before creating graphs with flot (https://github.com/flot/flot).

Additionally, Nest-Extended uses a modified version of a Humidity Control script from http://mbritten.x10.mx/ to adjust humidity relative to the external temperature.
